# small programs

This is just a place to put small programs I play with, in a variety
of languages, so that they don't get lost.  I've lost _so many_ programs
over the years by not keeping track of them.  From now on, they will
go in this repo.  If one ever grows substantially, I'll make a repo
just for it.

I'll make a directory per program, so they are easy to tell apart,
and give a readme for each one.
