# CastGeo in Haskell

*Note:* it turns out modern versions of GHC ship **without** a 
random number generator! I personally think that's crazy, but 
it is easily remedied via `cabal`:

    $ cabal install random

Other than that issue, the haskell implementation went very 
smoothly.  You can see this code is 
concise and clear.
