# ROBOTS

This is like the old unix game with "zombie" robots chasing you.
Use the cursor keys to move, and use the + to teleport.  Don't
fall in any of the holes ('o') and don't run into any of the 
robots ('R') or robot wreckage ('x').

To win, get all the robots to either fall into holes or run
into each other.  It's really not too difficult as long as 
you don't teleport into anything!
