# JavaFX Javax.Sound Oscillator

This was just a small program to play with Kotlin and Scala
in a JavaFX setting.  Also, I wanted to get a feel for 
what the `javax.sound` API is like.  In both versions, the program simply
presents a button and a slider, to play a 3-overtone sound wave
at the desired frequency.
