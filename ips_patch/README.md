# IPS Patcher

This is a small scala program to apply an IPS patch file to a 
source.  The format of an IPS file is described [here](http://www.zerosoft.zophar.net/ips.php).

Often when you run across a patch file, people want you to install some freeware patcher, 
which is hard to trust.  Better to write my own patch program than risk getting some kind
of crypto virus :)
