# Clock Angle

As discussed [at programming praxis][1] the other day, 
the problem is to calculate the angle between the 
hour and minute hand on a standard 12-hour clock.

For laughs I did the solution in Forth.

I noticed I used modulus in my solution, versus an
if-then check for 12 in their example answer. They 
are functionally equivalent.
