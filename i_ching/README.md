# I CHING Explorer

This is a simple program that I've written in several languages.
It makes a good test when learning a language because it's not too
involved, but still uses string, arrays, arithmetic, and user interaction.

 * **Forth**: This was the first version that I wrote, while learning
   Forth. It runs under gforth, and maybe others.   
 * **cweb**: This is a literate programming version in `C`.  This is the
   most performance-conscious of the implementations.  Probably overly-so,
   but I was trying to emphasize `C`'s strengths. It uses `ncurses` for 
   display.
 * **prolog**: This is a prolog version, which uses a very declarative
   method of describing the hexagrams (in `iching.dat`), which worked out
   very well. 
 * **haskell**: An implementation in haskell.  It assumes it's on an terminal
 that understands the typicall escape sequences. A fairly clean implementation,
 I think.
 * _others_: More languages will get added to the repo as time allows.
