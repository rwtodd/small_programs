# I CHING Explorer

This is a simple program that I've written in several languages.
It makes a good test when learning a language because it's not too
involved, but still uses string, arrays, arithmetic, and user interaction.

 * **Forth**: This was the first version that I wrote, while learning
   Forth. It runs under gforth, and maybe others.   
 * _others_: More languages will get added to the repo as time allows.
